# Logic Circuit Simulator

This is a logic circuit simulator written in [Processing](https://processing.org/).

It's still a WIP, so if you find any bugs or have any feedback, 
feel free to leave a message for me by creating a new [issue](https://github.com/DylanMcBean/LogicCircuitSimulator/issues).

# Install

The project needs to be in a folder called `logicGates` for Processing to run it, so you'll probably want to git clone it with that name. 

```
git clone --branch MostRecent https://github.com/DylanMcBean/LogicCircuitSimulator.git logicGates
```

Then, all you do is open up Processing, navigate to where you've cloned it, and open the `logicGates.pde` file within the logicGates directory.
